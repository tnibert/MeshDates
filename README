This is a script to pull the meeting dates from the Melbourne Eastern Suburbs Hackers
website and export them to an ical file for import to Google Calendar or similar
software.  It utilizes Beautiful Soup for pulling the data and its own ical class
for making the ical file.

The website could change and break this script.  As of 4 April 2016 it worked.
